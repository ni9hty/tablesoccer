# tablesoccer
to catch tablesoccer statistics in a simple way

Unfortunately we need to switch to a real db as of this WebSQL is bad for collaboration projects.
You can't choose where to save the db, it's created inside your chrome/safari profile folder.
I found it `~/.config/google-chrome/Default/databases/file__0/19` and did a copy to matches.db in this repo.

- last commit needs an installed nodejs `curl -sL install-node.now.sh | bash` and `npm install interactjs`
